                <p>Last updated: 31 July 2023</p>

                <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is News Pepe's policy to respect your privacy and comply with any
                    applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including
                    across our website, https://www.newspepe.co, and other sites we own and operate.</p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

                <p>Information we collect includes both information you knowingly and actively provide us when using or
                    participating in any of our services and promotions, and any information automatically sent by your
                    devices in the course of accessing our products and services.</p>

                <h2>Log Data</h2>

                <p>When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the standard data provided by your web
                    browser. This data is considered ‘non-identifying information’, as it does not personally identify
                    you on its own. It may include your computer’s IP address, your browser type and version, the pages
                    you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, and other details.</p>

                <h2>Use of Information</h2>

                <p>We may use a combination of identifying and non-identifying information to understand who our
                    visitors are, how they use our services, and how we may improve their experience of our website in
                    future. We do not disclose the specifics of this information publicly, but may share aggregated and
                    anonymized versions of this information, for example, in website and customer usage trend reports.
                </p>

                <h2>Security</h2>

                <p>We take security seriously, and do what we can within commercially acceptable means to protect your
                    personal information from loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or
                    modification.</p>
